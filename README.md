# Prototype-3
This repository contains Prototype 3, a Unity Learn Pathway project with two side-scrolling mini-games: a farmer runner, where a farmer jumps over obstacles to score points, and a balloon flight, where players control a balloon to dodge bombs and collect coins. Both focus on endless runner mechanics, physics-based movement, and score tracking.
